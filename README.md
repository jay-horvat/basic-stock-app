## About the Project

The Stock Market App is a simple, user-friendly application that retrieves stock data from a third-party API and presents it in a dynamic, interactive table. Users can search and filter through various stocks based on ticker, industry and name which all query the API at different endpoints. Once a stock is chosen users can look at a variety of metrics related to the asset, choose a different date range and can compare multiple stocks to one another.

## Features

### Front End

The front end of the Stock Market App is developed with **React** and **JavaScript**. It incorporates an organized component structure and a responsive layout, designed to handle and display real-time stock data from API calls. Please note the 3rd party API uses old and outdated stock data and is not current. The following front-end features enhance usability and data interaction:

- **Data Retrieval**: APIs connect to a third-party stock data provider, retrieving historical data on selected stocks based on name, stock ticker, industry and date. 
- **Interactive Table**: Stock data is displayed in a customizable table format that allows users to search and filter based on specific stock symbols, time frames, or other criteria.
- **Dynamic API Queries**: The app adjusts API queries to fetch different endpoints, allowing users to access a range of stock information such as price history, performance comparisons, and more.
