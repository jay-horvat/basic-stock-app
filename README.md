The **Stock Market App** is a front-end web application built with **React** and **JavaScript**. It allows users to access and explore stock data by leveraging third-party APIs, displaying the information in a searchable and filterable table format. Users can adjust the API queries for different endpoints, enabling customized views of the data according to their preferences.

The Stock Market App serves two main purposes:

1) To demonstrate my skills in front-end development, API integration, and data visualization in React.
2) To provide an accessible and functional stock exploration tool for users interested in monitoring stock data and trends.

As this project is primarily built for learning and showcasing purposes, instructions on hosting and deploying the application are not included.

## About the Project

The Stock Market App is a simple, user-friendly application that retrieves stock data from a third-party API and presents it in a dynamic, interactive table. Users can search, filter, and adjust their views by selecting different endpoints, allowing them to explore various stock metrics and historical data as per their needs.

## Features

### Front End

The front end of the Stock Market App is developed with **React** and **JavaScript**. It incorporates an organized component structure and a responsive layout, designed to handle and display real-time stock data from API calls. The following front-end features enhance usability and data interaction:

- **Data Retrieval**: APIs connect to a third-party stock data provider, retrieving current and historical data on selected stocks.
- **Interactive Table**: Stock data is displayed in a customizable table format that allows users to search and filter based on specific stock symbols, time frames, or other criteria.
- **Dynamic API Queries**: The app adjusts API queries to fetch different endpoints, allowing users to access a range of stock information such as price history, performance comparisons, and more.

Through the use of this setup, the application offers a seamless data exploration experience, empowering users with flexibility and control over the stock data they view.
